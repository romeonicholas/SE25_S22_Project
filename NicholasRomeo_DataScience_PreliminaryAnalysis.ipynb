    "### 1.Goal of my analysis\n",
    "TED Talks are incredibly popular videos with a wide reach and an air of clout. Whose voices are TED Talks amplifying, and what topics feature most prominently?\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller questions whose answers might feed into a response for the primary question: Who is the most prolific TED Talk speaker? What topics are the most commonly discussed? Which topics are the most popular in terms of view count and like count? How have TED Talks changed in frequency over time?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data Handling\n",
    "The data set used for this research was found at the website Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/ashishjangra27/ted-talks). It was collected by Ashish Jangra, a data scientist, by scraping the TED Talks website. There was no given date of scraping, which is relevant because many of the values provided can change over time (namely \"views\" and \"likes\"), and the latest provided date of a talk is broadly February 2022. Because the data was scraped by a third party there could be the potential for errors in the data (the scraping process wasn't shared), but looking at a few rows of data and comparing them to their counterparts on the website doesn't show any obvious problems. \n",
    "\n",
    "Probably the largest concern for this data set is that the data wasn't created with this type of analysis in mind, and so there are some inconsistencies in conventions. It will be hard to get an accurate count of speakers, for instance. Where multiple individuals' names are used in the \"author\" column, they are sometimes seperated by a comma (e.g. \"Al Roker, Al Gore\"), sometimes by the word \"and\" (e.g. \"David Biello and Latif Nasser\"), sometimes by an ampersand (e.g. \"Peta Greenfield & Alex Gendler\"), or some combination of these when 3 or more speakers are involved. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data provided comes in six columns: \n",
    "1. \"title\": Title of the Ted Talk (string) \n",
    "2. \"author\": Name of Author(s)/Speaker(s)/Organization (string)\n",
    "3. \"date\": Month and year when the talk took place (Month YYYY string)\n",
    "4. \"views\": Number of non-unique video views (integer)\n",
    "5. \"likes\": Number of likes (integer)\n",
    "6. \"link\": URL of the published talk (string)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are 5440 rows available, with 5440 unique titles and links. Because dates are given in a \"Month YYYY\" format there are only 127 unique date values (ranging from February 2004 to February 2022). There are 4444 unique author values, meaning there will be useful data for identifying repeat authors. \n",
    "\n",
    "For my research purposes I will need to do minimal data cleaning. I'll remove the \"link\" column because there isn't any added value to it for my purposes (it follows a standard \"base URL + author + title convention\", without providing any new data). There only appears to be a single non-null value in the \"author\" column that I'll also need to investigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of my quantitative analysis will come from the \"views\", \"likes\", and \"date\" columns of this data set since their formats (integers and dates) allow for the most calculations. I'll be reporting summary statistics for views and likes (mean, median, ranges) both over time and for different authors. These will also make for useful visualizations--scatterplotting likes and views over time should give a broad sense of the change of reach over time. A histogram of how many talks are given every month over time compared to likes and views over time might demonstrate how the quantity of material impacts the overall reach of the talks (i.e. do 5 talks in one month generate 5 times as many views as 1 talk in one month?). I've already identified the most prolific author (Alex Gendler at 45 talks) and busiest month for talks (April 2018 with 127 talks), but there's more analysis that can be done here--like does an author's viewership over time follow a similar path to overall viewership over time, or does a specific author's viewership grow the more they speak? If repeat authors have outsized impacts on viewership \n",
    "\n",
    "The question of which topics are most discussed is more complicated. I've attempted to parse out some common topics by taking the most common words in talk titles (minus stop words and some manually removed numbers and symbols I considered irrelevent), and will reapply them to each talk by adding a new \"tag\" column. There are a lot of problems with this approach (a talk titled \"The world is on fire\" wouldn't get tagged with \"climate\" even if it was about global warming, for instance) so I don't expect to find anything definitive by doing this, but I'm hoping it provides at least some insights into more broadly popular topics and how language is used in the titles. Beyond just the subject matter of Ted Talks, I'm interested in who Ted Talks might be directed towards or speaking about, so I've started a preliminary count of gendered words (e.g. \"man\" and \"men\" v \"woman\" and \"men\") in titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "One additional step I'm considering taking to help answer the question of whose voices are being emphasized by Ted Talks is scraping their site for job titles for every author as it's already available and could be easily mapped to the existing data, because I think there might be some interesting patterns. I would have loved additional biographical information about Ted Talk authors like gender or nationality, but that doesn't appear to be available to me. "
